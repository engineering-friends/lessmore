# About 

Lots of useful functional programming utilities, most of which are based on the more_itertools library.

# more_itertools 
This one is in alpha. 

In the `more_itertools_renamed` subdirectory there is an opinionated overview of the more_itertools functions, some are imported with alternative names, and some are not imported with _ prefix (which means that I didn't find the better name/or something like that). 

It's outdated and should be reviewed.
