# [About multiline code]

"""
# Multi-line code rules

## Languages without multi-line comments will use single line comment replacement.

Like that: 
/* 
Foo

Bar
*/ -> 

// Foo
// 
// Bar

## Languages with multi-line comments will be forced to use multi-line comments instead. 

"""

# [Misc]

# There should be a new line between comment and multi-line comment.

# [Tooling]

# - До и после нужна ровно одна строчка строчка и начинать писать с большой буквы.
# multiline hash comments -> multiline comments
